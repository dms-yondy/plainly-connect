# Plainly Connect

A game inspired by the BBC quiz show “Only Connect”. The game is simple, you are given a wall of sixteen elements. Each element in the wall is linked to another three elements in the wall by some sort of connection, for example “Green”, “Memory”, “Good Luck” and “Debit” would have the connection that you could put the word “Card” after each of them. You solve the wall by finding all four of the connections in the wall. The wall will always have a number of elements that could fit into more than one of the four connections on the wall, this is done to make solving the wall harder.

The technologies used in coding the game were JavaScript, CSS3, HTML5, NodeJS and MongoDB. I decided against using a front-end framework like React for this project because I wanted to improve by vanilla JavaScript skills.
